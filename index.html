				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<img src="images/aboutme/woman_600.png" alt="Kylie Psuedo Photo">	
				<p>
					With 15 years of teaching experience including 4 years as Acting Assistant Principal, 
					I have always been passionate about quality teaching and I strive to meet the individual 
					needs of all students. My energetic and positive attitude allows me to develop quality 
					relationships with students, staff and community members. As a teacher, I aim to 
					produce highly motivating, challenging and engaging learning experiences for all 
					students. I always cater for diverse learning styles by incorporating a variety of 
					dynamic teaching strategies. I provide a supportive and organised classroom environment, 
					one that stimulates learning and promotes positive behaviour through consistent and 
					high expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					With my knowledge and skills developed in my current Masters in ICT in Education and 
					previous Graduate Certificate in eLearning courses, as well as my extensive experience 
					with iPads, Apple TVs/IWBs and laptops in the classroom, I am dedicated to infusing 
					technology into teaching and learning, by designing tasks that challenge and prepare 
					students for the future. Throughout the year, I ensure student progress is regularly 
					monitored and assessed against the Australian Curriculum whilst consistently providing 
					feedback to students and parents. With my excellent interpersonal skills, I ensure a 
					positive rapport with all students and I strive to enhance teacher, parent and community 
					relationships. 
				</p>
				<p>
					As demonstrated in the Employment History of my curriculum vitae (see attached), I aim 
					to engage with students in areas outside of the classroom by taking on co-curricular 
					activities to promote a well-rounded education. With my outgoing and inviting personality, 
					I work well in a team environment. I am highly motivated to achieve my best in all areas 
					of teaching and I thrive to take on new challenges and responsibilities. With my strong 
					knowledge and practical experience, I believe I would be an excellent asset to your school.

						<h4>Coding Club</h4>
						<p>
						The Coding Club involves teaching students the basic programming concepts such as loops and events. 
						Lessons also teach students to collaborate with others meaningfully, investigate different 
						problem-solving techniques, persist in the face of difficult tasks, and learn about internet safety. 
						At the end, students create their very own custom game or story they can share.

							A Drama Club was held during one lunch time a week and was open to any students in Years 5-6 to join. 
							The group participated in a variety of games and acting activities, focusing on expression, impromptu 
							acting and scripted short plays. They performed their skit called, ‘A Twisted Tale’. The item is a 
							fairy tale story that has been altered to create a comedic representation of a mixture of fairy tales. 
							They were responsible for learning their lines, creating the backdrops and props for the play and 
							developing suitable costumes for their characters. The show was a hit amongst their peers at the School 
							Assembly. What a talented group of actors and actresses we have!
